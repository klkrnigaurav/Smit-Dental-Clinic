                    You have three options for whitening them. Your dentist can use a whitening agent and a special
                    light. Or you can bleach them at home with a plastic tray and gel from your dentist or a store. The
                    simplest choice, whitening toothpaste and whitening rinses, only remove surface stains.

                <p class=" pt-4 pl-9 font-bold">These little holes in your teeth are bad news. You get them when a sticky bacteria, called plaque, builds up on your teeth, slowly destroying the hard outer shell, called enamel. <br> Adults can also have problems with tooth decay at the gum line and around the edges of earlier fillings. To prevent it, brush your teeth at least twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste, limit snacks, floss daily, rinse with a fluoride mouthwash, and keep up with your dental appointments. Ask your dentist if you could benefit from a sealant.

                <p class=" pt-4 pl-9 font-bold">It's the No. 1 type of dental injury. An accident can cause a chip. So can something much less dramatic, like chomping popcorn. <br> Your dentist may recommend a crown if the chip is large or bonding with a strong resin material to replace the area that chipped. If the pulp is at risk, you may need a root canal followed by a veneer or crown.

It usually happens when a tooth is stuck against another tooth, bone, or soft tissue. <br> If it  isn't bothering you, a dentist may recommend leaving it alone.  But if it hurts or may cause problems later on, an oral surgeon can remove it.

                <p class=" pt-4 pl-9 font-bold">You were playing football without a mouth guard, or chewing, or maybe you don’t know how it happened, but now you’ve got a cracked molar. Can your dentist save the tooth? It depends. Most dentist recommend crowns for cracked teeth to prevent the crack from worsening. <br> If the tooth is sensitive to hot and cold, the problem is more complex. Try to chew on the other side until you see your dentist. If the crack is above the gum line, you may need a root canal and a crown. A deeper crack means the tooth must be pulled, though. Fillings can increase the chance of a crack.

It could be cavities, worn tooth enamel or fillings, gum disease, fractured teeth, or exposed roots. <br><br> Once your dentist figures out the problem, you might need a filling, a root canal, or treatment of your gums to replace tissue lost at the root. Or you might just need a desensitizing toothpaste or strip, or a fluoride gel.

It's rare, but some people have extra teeth, which is called hyperdontia. <br><br> People who have it may also have another condition, such as a cleft palate or Gardner’s Syndrome (which forms tumors that aren't cancer). The treatment is to get the extra teeth removed and use orthodontics to correct the bite.

And straightening crooked teeth and aligning your bite doesn’t just make for a prettier smile. <br><br> It can be an key part of improving overall dental health, relieving symptoms like jaw pain.  Orthodontists may use braces (metal or trays), aligners, and retainers.

A buildup of plaque, a sticky bacteria, below the gum line causes it. <br><br> Left untreated, it can at some point cause bone loss, and your teeth might shift or become loose. That can make it harder to chew and even speak. To avoid gum disease, brush, floss, and rinse with an antiseptic mouthwash daily, and see your dentist for regular cleanings.

If you grind your teeth at night, ask your dentist to fit you with a mouth guard. If it’s a daytime problem, try meditation, exercise, or other ways to curb stress.
